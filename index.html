        <h2>Problem statement: VPN service - privacy put in consideration</h2>
        <p>
          VPN”s are supposed to be private and secure, but they require you to
          trust them 100%. Suppose there is a software that streamlines the
          process of creating your own VPN. This software would enable users to
          set up their own personal VPN server, offering them complete control
          over their data and privacy.
